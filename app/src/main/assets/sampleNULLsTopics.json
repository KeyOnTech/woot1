      "body": "[Editor’s note: This bundle was originally planned to include pepper spray as a “humorously” inappropriate toy. However, our lawyers and common sense suggested we remove the pepper spray from the bundle. The following product description was written before this change, and has been edited to reflect it. We apologize. The person responsible for the pepper spray idea has been pepper sprayed.] **Have you heard of the new** ~~thing the~~ **kids** ~~are doing? It’s called “Peppering.” You take a can of pepper spray and shoot it~~ **on** ~~your face as long as you can. Lawmakers have recently learned of~~ **the** ~~phenomenon and are taking steps to have pepper spray~~ **block**~~ed for sale to minors.~~ ~~What are~~ **they** ~~thinking, these kids? Why~~ **were a** ~~bunch of~~ **boy**~~s in Wyoming recently caught spraying themselves in the face before~~ **band** ~~practice? The fact~~ **that** ~~they~~ **enjoyed** ~~it has been~~ **success**~~fully demonstrated~~ **in** ~~interviews with~~ **the** ~~boys. It’s too~~ **early** ~~to say how widespread “peppering” is, but parents haven’t been this upset since the violent video game scare of the~~ **1990s**. ~~Some parents report that~~ **their** ~~children take~~ “**hits**” ~~of pepper spray to the face until one of them gives up. Others play a more elaborate game that~~ **include**~~s many parts.~~ **Step** ~~1: Spray yourself in the face with pepper spray~~ **by** ~~yourself.~~ **Step** ~~2: Spray yourself in the face with pepper spray while others watch and cheer.~~ **And** ~~although most kids enjoy “peppering” while~~ **hanging** ~~out with friends, others are reported to have made it a solo endeavor. Officials say it has been~~ **tough** ~~to collect data on this latter trend.~~ **They** ~~also aren’t~~ **sure** ~~about the geographical distributing of “Peppering.” The first reports of the behavior~~ **were** ~~reported on the West Coast but it has been~~ **pretty** ~~difficult to triangulate back to the specific source.~~ **We** ~~aren’t suggesting you buy these bundles of toys and give the pepper spray to your children. If you keep that for yourself your children won’t~~ **miss them**~~. Then you can try “peppering” yourself and see if you like it~~ **very much**."
